<h2>STEP 10: INSTALL OPERATING SYSTEM</h2>
<p>Parts/tools: PC, monitor, mouse, keyboard, OS saved to a flash drive<br>

If you haven’t already prepared your operating system (OS) on a USB flash drive, now is the time to do so. (See the above section on operating systems under “PREP 3: Select your components” for more details.)<br>

Plug in the USB flash drive that contains your OS, as well as a monitor, mouse, and keyboard, and turn on your PC.<br>

The first screen you see will tell you to press a key to enter the system setup or BIOS. Press the key to open BIOS. (If the screen flashes off too quickly for you to see the key, consult your motherboard's user manual.)<br>
First, you'll want to check to makes sure your components are all installed and being recognized. Find the page in BIOS that shows your PC's system info (different motherboards have different BIOS setups, but you should be able to find a screen that gives you this information) and check to make sure the system is recognizing everything you've installed so far.<br>

Next, poke around BIOS until you find the Boot page (may be called "Boot Order" or "Boot Priority"). Change the boot order so that your flash drive is first and the drive you want to install your OS on (if you're using an SSD as a boot drive, you will want to install the OS here) is second.<br>

Restart your computer. Your computer will boot from the USB and the OS installer will pop up. Follow the instructions to finish the installation.</p>

<h2>IT DOESN'T END HERE</h2>

<p>If you’ve made it all the way through our guide, congratulations on finishing your build (especially if this is your first time)! The work, however, doesn’t necessarily have to end here.<br>

The best thing about building your own gaming PC is that the job is never truly finished. As advancements in hardware continue to emerge, a custom PC’s capacity for customization is nearly limitless, and your own rig can be as up-to-date as you desire according to both your needs and budget.<br>

When you’re next checking the recommended specs for a new game you want to play, keep these possibilities in mind. The PC you just built will serve as your foundation for all the gaming experiences ahead, and fine-tuning your components is all part of the fun of owning it.<br>

Now that you know how to build a gaming PC, consider integrating your machine into a fully fledged battlestation. You can also learn how to get the most out of your build via advanced techniques like overclocking your CPU.</p>
