<h2>STEP 9: INSTALL STORAGE</h2>

<p>Parts/tools: Motherboard, SSDs, HDDs, Phillips #2 screwdriver, screws, case/chassis user manual<br>

Firstly, inspect your case. Every case is a little different when it comes to drive bays.<br>

You should be able to find a stack of bays in different sizes somewhere inside your case. They may have little plastic switches, in which case they are tool-free bays, or they may just look like metal brackets.<br>

Storage generally comes in two sizes, 2.5-inch (HDDs and SSDs) and 3.5-inch (HDDs). Most 3.5-inch bays can accept 2.5-inch drives, but not vice versa (some 3.5-inch bays will have trays that aren't designed for 2.5-inch drives, but they can still fit 2.5-inch bays). You may also see larger bays in your case — these are for larger drives such as optical drives and are usually located in the front of the case, near the top.<br>

If you have tool-free bays, each bay will have its own plastic lever or switch. Open or unlock the lever or switch and you should be able to pull out the tray. Place your drive in the tray — some 3.5-inch trays will be designed to accept 2.5-inch trays. If they are, you'll need to screw the 2.5-inch drive to the 3.5-inch tray so it doesn't move around.</p>

<p>Slide the tray back into the bay. It should click into place.
If you don't have tool-free bays, you'll see a metal bracket (it will be big, like a sheet), with slats or holes in it. To put a drive in one of these "bays," all you have to do is slide the drive between the metal bracket and the side of your case and screw it into place. Use as many screws as the chassis manual recommends, but if you don't have enough screws most drives will be fine with just two screws.</p>

<p>Once your drives are all in place, connect them to the motherboard (using a SATA cable, which should have come with either your drive or your motherboard) and to the power supply.</p>
