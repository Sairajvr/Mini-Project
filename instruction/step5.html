<h2>STEP 5: (OPTIONAL) DO A TEST RUN OUTSIDE THE CASE</h2>

<p>Parts/tools: Motherboard with CPU and CPU cooler installed, RAM, GPU, PSU, screwdriver, motherboard user manual, PC monitor (attached to GPU)<br>

Now that you've installed the CPU and the CPU cooler, you may want to perform a quick test run of your components just to make sure they all work. This test is much more difficult to perform (and troubleshoot) once everything is installed in the chassis. To do this, install GPU and connect everything to the power supply (if you don't know how to install the GPU, see section below). Make sure the power supply is connected to the motherboard (both CPU 8pin and 24pin) and GPU, then plug it in and turn it on.</p>

<p>Some higher-end motherboards have power buttons, but many do not. If you don't see a power button, locate the power switch pins â€” small pairs of prongs sticking out of colorful nodules. The power switch pins may be labeled (something like "PWR_ON"). To turn the motherboard on, use a screwdriver to tap both power switch pins at once.
You should now be able to tell if any of your components are dead or otherwise malfunctioning. If your motherboard is blinking lights or beeping at you, it's probably trying to tell you something. Some motherboards have a post code display (two digits) to help you identify what the problem is. To figure out what it's trying to tell you, consult your user manual. If your motherboard has no post code display, connect a display to the GPU and see if your system "posts" or starts up and displays the motherboard's logo.<br>

When you are finished with the test run, turn off the power supply and wait for any LEDs on the motherboard to go dark to ensure there's no residual power in the system. Then, uninstall the GPU and unplug all power cables before proceeding with the next step.</p>
